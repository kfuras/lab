# 🛠️ Lab

In this repo, I collect my **labs, projects, scripts, and experiments** which I use for:

- Learning and testing new technologies
- Exploring DevOps and infrastructure tooling
- Gaining hands-on experience beyond theory

## 🧪 What's inside

This repository may include:

- Docker Compose stacks for testing services
- k3s cluster experiments and Kubernetes YAMLs
- Tools like my blog image generator (Python + PIL)
- Automation scripts and shell helpers

All projects live in subfolders with self-contained configs, and everything here is version-controlled to reflect my process.

## Why this exists

- To document my journey as an IT consultant branching into DevOps
- To practice real-world scenarios, not just lab theories
- To maintain a public log of what I’m working on, learning, or improving

## Languages / Tools used

> This varies by folder/project, but includes:

- `Python`
- `Shell` (`bash`, `zsh`)
- `Docker` / `Docker Compose`
- `YAML`
- `Markdown`
- `Kubernetes` (K3s, manifests)
